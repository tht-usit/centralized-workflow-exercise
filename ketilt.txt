Why must dinosaurs wear hats?

They are not partial to the wearing of hats.

Neither are hats keen on dinosaurs' heads.

We suggest changing the constitution.

It should no longer force dinosaur and hat symbiosis.

This was never natural anyway.

Contact your local representatives.

Free the hats.

Hug the dinosaurs.

World peace will be had.
